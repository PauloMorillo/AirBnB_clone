# Airbnb clone

Airbnb is a web platform to rent house, rooms and more. This is the first step to clone it. In this step we did a console to manage the objects created by the classes to do easier the way to add, del, destroy and update objects. Also we use a file JSON to store and persist objects. and obviusly we created our data model.

## Command interpreter

Like we did before this command interpreter is a console to manage the objects created by our classes (Create, update, destroy)

To start the console use you have to stay in the path (Airbnb_clone/) where the file console.py is and execute it.

```bash

./console.py

```

## How to use the console
To use the console you can do it with interactive mode or non interactive mode like we show you there.

Interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./console.py
```
```bash
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

Non Interactive mode:

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
```
```bash
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
